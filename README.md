# anyfont4itch
Use any desired custom font on [itch.io](https://itch.io/) with a woff2, woff, otf, or ttf file.

Itch.io pages are limited to the use of fonts hosted on Google Fonts. While this does allow for a multitude of options (1,731 different fonts as of 2024), many games have specific fonts used in game and associated with their brand. Using your games font on itch is relatively simple and will align your page with your games theming/aesthetic.
