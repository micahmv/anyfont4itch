Use any desired custom font on [itch.io](https://itch.io/) with a woff2, woff, otf, or ttf font file.

[Itch.io](https://itch.io/)'s pages are limited to the use of fonts hosted on Google Fonts. While this does allow for a multitude of options (1,731 different fonts as of 2024), many projects have specific fonts used in game or associated with their brand. Using your games font on itch is relatively simple and will align your page with your games theming/aesthetic.

## CSS Account Access
Before being able to add custom CSS for your page, you will need to enable CSS permissions for your account. This is done by sending an email to [support@itch.io](mailto:support@itch.io). Itch instructs to include the type of intended changes and a confirmation of only configuring visuals. See full on instructions on what to include in your email [here](https://itch.io/docs/creators/css-guide#getting-css-access). Response times vary, however itch generally approves all requests. Once you have your account access come back to this page and continue to the next step.
