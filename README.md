# anyfont4itch
Use any desired custom font on [itch.io](https://itch.io/) with a woff2, woff, otf, or ttf font file.

[Itch.io](https://itch.io/)'s pages are limited to the use of fonts hosted on Google Fonts. While this does allow for a multitude of options (1,731 different fonts as of 2024), many projects have custom fonts used in game or associated with their brand. Using your projects font on itch is relatively simple and will align your page with your games theming/aesthetic.

## Enable CSS Account Access
Before being able to add custom CSS for your page, you will need to enable CSS permissions for your account. This is done by sending an email to [support@itch.io](mailto:support@itch.io). 

Itch instructs to include the type of intended changes and a confirmation of only configuring visuals. See full on instructions on what to include in your email [here](https://itch.io/docs/creators/css-guide#getting-css-access). 

Response times vary, however itch generally approves all requests. Once you have your account access come back to this page and continue to the next step.

## Convert Font File to Base64
To use the font on itch.io, the file needs to be converted to Base64. This process encodes the file into a long string of characters, which can then be included with the rest of the css. To convert your file, there exist a variety of online options. Iâ€™ve used https://base64.guru/converter/encode/file for this purpose.

## Copy & Paste Custom CSS
With your account now having CSS access, paste what's below in your itch.io pages Custom CSS section from the 'Edit theme' button on your page.

Paste the relevant @font-face to the file you encoded to Base64:
```css
/* WOFF2 Web Open Font Format 2 */
@font-face {
    font-family: 'custom-font';
    src: url(data:font/woff2;charset=utf-8;base64,PASTE_BASE64_CONVERSION_OF_WOFF2_FILE_HERE) format('woff2');
}
```
```css
/* WOFF Web Open Font Format */
@font-face {
    font-family: 'custom-font';
    src: url(data:font/woff;charset=utf-8;base64,PASTE_BASE64_CONVERSION_OF_WOFF_FILE_HERE) format('woff');
}
```
```css
/* OTF OpenType */
@font-face {
    font-family: 'custom-font';
    src: url(data:font/otf;charset=utf-8;base64,PASTE_BASE64_CONVERSION_OF_OTF_FILE_HERE) format('opentype');
}
```
```css
/* TTF TrueType */
@font-face {
    font-family: 'custom-font';
    src: url(data:font/ttf;charset=utf-8;base64,PASTE_BASE64_CONVERSION_OF_TTF_FILE_HERE) format('truetype');
}
```

Paste the below for a **PROJECT** page:
```css
/* Apply the custom font to the specified HTML elements */
/* Page content including description, more information, download, devlogs, comments, etc */
.left_col.column {
    font-family: custom-font;
}

/* Footer (bottom of the page) that shows: ITCH.IO--VIEW ALL BY CREATOR--REPORT--EMBED      TYPE*GENRE*PRICE */
.footer a {
    font-family: custom-font;
}

/* Last updated timestamp in the footer after EMBED */
.update_timestamp {
    font-family: custom-font;
}
```

Paste the below for a **PROFILE** page
```css
/* Apply the custom font to the specified HTML elements */
/* Profile name */
.inner_column.text_header {
    font-family: custom-font;
}

/* Profile links */
.user_links a {
    font-family: mono;
}

/* The content of your profile page */
.user_profile.formatted {
    font-family: custom-font;
}

/* Games including their title, description, genre, and play in browser if web */
.column.game_column {
    font-family: custom-font;
}

/* Footer (bottom of the page) */
.footer {
    font-family: custom-font;
}
```

## Helpful CSS for Text Settings & Sizing
It's likely you'll need to find the right settings and size for your text to fit your page. As well, different sections (like body vs footer) might need different text sizes. CSS is a styling language and there exists much more to customize your text, this is just a minimum to have correct text settings and size your text to fit your page. 

Paste any of the lines below between the {} of the @font-face to apply to all text or into the {} of any specified html element to apply individually.
```css
@font-face or .specified-element {
    font-weight: normal; /* options: normal, bold, bolder, lighter or a specified thickness value */
    font-style: normal; /* options: normal, italic, oblique */
    font-size: 20px;
    letter-spacing: 1px; /* space between characters */
}
```

## Reached Maximum Character Count?
Itch Custom CSS inclusion has a maximum character count. Large files converted to Base64 will be encoded as longer strings. As such it's possible to fill up the character count from a files size/Base64 strings length, the inclusion of multiple fonts, or having a significant amount of added custom css. In this case, I would recommend using woff2 exclusively as the file converted to Base64 as it's the smallest file web font data type. Another solution can be using a url to an online hosted font file to reduce characters used by Base64 font characters.

## Loading Font from URL
If your font is already being hosted online and is consistently accessible you can simply load it using the url.
```css
@font-face {
    font-family: 'custom-font';
    src: url('YOUR_WEB_HOSTED_WOFF2_FILE_URL_PATH') format('woff2'),
         url('YOUR_WEB_HOSTED_WOFF_FILE_URL_PATH') format('woff'),
         url('YOUR_WEB_HOSTED_OTF_FILE_URL_PATH') format('opentype'),
         url('YOUR_WEB_HOSTED_TTF_FILE_URL_PATH') format('truetype');
}
```
